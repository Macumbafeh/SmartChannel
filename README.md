# SmartChannel

## What is it

SmartChannel enables a feature I liked on retail wow, where typing /i will automatically select the isntance channel to talk in.
With SmartChannel installed you can automatically select party/raid/bg channel by typing /i.


## How to install

Go to Releases in https://github.com/nullfoxh/SmartChannel/releases and download SmartChannel.zip. Extract it to your World of Warcraft/Interface/AddOns folder and you're done! Once you're done the path should look like World of Warcraft/Interface/AddOns/SmartChannel/SmartChannel.toc.
